# Hub

The Hub is an interface device for 3rd party inputs.
You can build your own input devices or connect compatible off the shelf products, like the [Logitech Adaptive Gaming Kit](https://www.logitechg.com/de-ch/products/gamepads/adaptive-gaming-kit-accessories).

## Inputs

The Hub has **4 analog** inputs (A1 to A4) and **4 digital** inputs (D1 to D4).

The six 3.5 mm jack sockets have the following input assignments, see also [Phone connector (audio)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)).



## Settings

On Input 1 and 2, the Hub accepts stereo jack plugs with two analog signals. This is convenient for building Joysticks or other two-axis devices with just one cable.
The second analog channel for Input 1 and 2 can be activated in the device settings.
